First, I am interested in science policy, which I take to mean both understanding the impact that science can have on society as well as how policies influence science. At Yenching Academy, I conducted my thesis research on wrote my master’s thesis on the importance of international collaborations in scientific careers (abbreviated version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UVltLtMLFFbWpFjhMvVl--pqGtNbmb1V/view?usp=drive_link)). At Oxford, I founded the Science Policy Discussions student council project to facilitate dialogue among students on these topics (get in touch to join our WhatsApp group). I believe the governance of AI, the role of academia in combatting contributions to climate change and DEI to be particularly important topics in this area. I have [written on the topic of AI governance](https://jjccihr.medium.com/what-insights-are-needed-for-the-ai-that-we-want-0ed8656d0273) for John Jay College's Center for International Human Rights.

Second, I strive to do research and help work on topics of social relevance. During my master’s in neuroscience, I was a research assistant on Steven Pinker's book, [Rationality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56224080-rationality). As an undergraduate, I contributed to research on climate change modelling and air quality monitoring and worked for a German NGO. I am currently looking for additional possibilities here in the realm of applied behavioral science!
