I am a computational cognitive neuroscience PhD student at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford. My thesis focuses on deep reinforcement learning as task-driven models of human behavior. I am lucky to be jointly co-supervised by Professors Christopher Summerfield (Oxford) and Wulfram Gerstner (EPFL).

I am passionate about a wide range of neuroscience research, including the learning dynamics of connectionist models, the emergence of cognitive flexibility, the development of responses to the exploration-exploitation trade-off, as well as applications of behavioral science to social decision-making. I aim to use theoretical models to make behavioral predictions that can then be studied in simple experimental paradigms.

I am eager to hear from potential collaborators or others who are interested in my research or in sharing their own. You can email me (kai dot sandbrink at psy dot ox dot ac dot uk), follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/@kaisa)/[X](https://twitter.com/ackaijsa), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaisandbrink/). I am especially happy to hear from people who belong to groups traditionally underrepresented in science.
