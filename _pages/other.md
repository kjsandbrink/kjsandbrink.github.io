I have many interests that go beyond traditional areas of neuroscience and psychology; on this page I am sharing just a few words about the relevant ones!

First, I am interested in science policy, which I take to mean both understanding the impact that science can have on society as well as how policies influence science. At Yenching Academy, I conducted my thesis research on wrote my master’s thesis on the importance of international collaborations in scientific careers (abbreviated version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UVltLtMLFFbWpFjhMvVl--pqGtNbmb1V/view?usp=drive_link)). At Oxford, I founded the Science Policy Discussions student council project to facilitate dialogue among students on these topics (get in touch to join our WhatsApp group). I believe the role of academia in combatting contributions to climate change and DEI to be particularly important topics in this area.

The other is through doing research and working on topics of social relevance. During my master’s in neuroscience, I was a research assistant on Steven Pinker's book, [Rationality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56224080-rationality). As an undergraduate, I contributed to research on climate change modelling and air quality monitoring and worked for a German NGO. I am currently looking for additional possibilities here in the realm of applied behavioral science!
